This code i submitted for humAIn contest for the problem vehicle Number  plate detection

Since i have interested in making the Artificial inteligence Object detection so i have Implemented the Vehicle number plate detection

I have used Python Libraries for implementing this project

First set the Dataset path before running the python file.

Now run the Python file.

At first it will show all the number plates extracted contents.

Finaally you need to enter Any numbers between 0 - 237
